			<h1>Metrolec Humble Beginning</h1>
			<p>Metrolec Enterprise was established in the Philippines sometime in 1993 with a humble beginning and started out as small trading company. During the years of our existence, Metrolec had learned to cope with various problems that affected our operation. The company had learned to cope with these by being more dedicated, disciplined and aggressive in dealing many problems in order to survive.</p>


			<h2>Technical Know How</h2>
			<p>We kept our focus on how to minimize our expenses by strategizing scientific approach, technical know-how and aggressive marketing to address it properly by maintaining on-time deliveries and completion with very minimal back-jobs. Prompt after sales service was also proven to be an effective tool to get the trust and confidence of our customers which led them to patronize our product  even up to this date.</p>
