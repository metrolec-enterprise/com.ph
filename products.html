				<h2>MSI Slave Intercom</h2>
				<p>Considering your modern lift elevators nowadays are using sophisticated variable speed drives and other industrial electronics that can be amplified up to 10 to 15 times in parallel resonance circuit (to pull car elevators up and down), harmonic currents are produced that resulted to distorted signals. This problem has been effectively addressed by our intercom and now considered a thing of the past giving you a loud, clear and audible voice output</p>
